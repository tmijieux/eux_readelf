* Description
  Very basic clone of readelf utility.

  This program does not aim for correctness.
  Be aware that this program was written without learning about the elf norm
  anymore than just barely reading =man elf= and =elf.h=
    
* Compile and Run
  Compilation depends on gengetopt to generate 
  the source code which handle command line options.
  #+begin_src shell
  make
  #+end_src
  
  Running the program has no library dependency except for libc.
  (Test have been made with latest GNU libc installed by ArchLinux package releases)
